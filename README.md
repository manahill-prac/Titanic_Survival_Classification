## Project Overview
This project predicts **passenger survival on the Titanic** using historical passenger data.  
It applies **Machine Learning classification models** to forecast whether a passenger survived based on key features:

- Pclass (Ticket Class)  
- Sex  
- Age  
- SibSp (Siblings/Spouses aboard)  
- Parch (Parents/Children aboard)  
- Fare  
- Embarked  
- Engineered Features: *FamilySize, IsAlone*

The project covers:

- Data preprocessing & cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Model evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1)
